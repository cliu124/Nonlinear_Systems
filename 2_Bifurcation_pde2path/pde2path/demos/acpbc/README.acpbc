Demos for Allen-Cahn type equations with **periodic BCs** (pBC). 

ac1Dpbc, ac2Dpbc, and ac3Dpbc: AC equation with pBCs in 1D,2D and 3D, but 
WITHOUT TRANSLATIONAL INVARIANCE, which is broken by some x-dependent terms. 

ac1Dpbc-b and ac2Dpbc-b: with translational invariance, hence requiring a phase 
condition (pBC). 

acqlpbc: a quasilinear version (2D) with pBCs
