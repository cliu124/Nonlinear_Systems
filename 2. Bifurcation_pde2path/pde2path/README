README from the pde2path root folder. 
---------------------------------------------
Setup: In principle, you just have to execute 
setpde2path 
from the command window, or by loading it into the editor by typing 
edit setpde2path.m 
and executing it from there. 

This sets the matlab paths to the (default) libraries and makes 
available the help system. For the latter, type 
p2phelp 
in the command window. 

To use  *** pqzschur ***, go into the incl3rdpartylibs/pqzschur folder and *mex* it, 
following the instructions in pqzschur/README. 

To use the iterative linear system solvers from *** ilupack *** (linux and mac), 
you must download them from, e.g., 
(a) http://ilupack.tu-bs.de/
or 
(b) https://github.com/fastsolve/ilupack4m  (recommended, as it includes 
                 octave support; downloads the actual library from (a)). 
In both cases, place the downloaded folder outside the pde2path tree, for 
instance one directory up, and follow the instructions at the sites or in 
the downloaded folders to *mex* the library. 
Subsequently, depending on the version/directory you chose, you may have to 
adapt setpde2path and call it again. 

To use pde2path in *** octave *** (this is work in progress), cd into the 
folder pde2path/octave and follow the instructions in README. 
Currently there is no direct windows support for ilupack. 
--------------------------------------------
First steps: We believe the best way to start is to follow some tutorial from 
*tuthome*, i.e., 
http://www.staff.uni-oldenburg.de/hannes.uecker/pde2path/tutorials.html

where probably 

Rademacher/Uecker, The OOPDE setting of pde2path - a tutorial via some Allen-Cahn models 

is easiest. For this, cd into pde2path/demos/acsuite/ac1D_simple, call 
edit cmds.m 
and execute this script CELL-BY-CELL (to see what a given cell does). 
In parallel, have the tutorial-pdf on the screen or desk. 

An overview of (almost) all of the pde2path demos, and an overview of the 
data-structures and functions, and further tips and tricks, are given in the 
"Quickstart guide and reference card" at (*tuthome*). 
Additionally, the folders demos/ and hopfdemos/ contain README(s) giving 
overviews of the contained demo collections and directories. 
Finally, most of the demo-directories contain a file aaa.txt which 
gives a short description of the problem and the m-files used to implement it.  

When you want to study your own new problem, copy a similar pde2path demo to a new 
directory OUTSIDE THE PDE2PATH FOLDER (separate program data from user data) and start 
modifying the files there.

Happy continuation and bifurcation, 

the pde2path developers.
