The folder demos/ contains the following subfolders, which again contain some READMEs 
with more details. 

acsuite: A collection of demos dealing with **Allen-Cahn** (AC) type equations of 
the form u_t=Lu+f(u), where u:Omega->R is a scalar function, Omega a domain (mostly a box)
in 1D, 2D, or 3D, L is the Laplacian (in 1D, 2D and 3D), and f(u)=lam*u+u^3-u^5  (cubic-quintic case). 
With various boundary conditions (BCs), except periodic BCs; demos for these are collected in acpbc. 

acpbc: Allen-Cahn type equations with **periodic BCs** (pBC). 

geomtut: A collection of demos dealing with **geometric bifurcation problems** as 
described in the "Geometric bifurcation problems in pde2path" tutorial. 
 
hofem: Some demos illustrating the use of **higher order FEM**. 

JBDMV: The demos described in "Hannes Uecker: Num.cont..", JBDMV, 2021 

pftut: Demos describing ** pattern formation problems **, e.g. for 4th order equations 
such as the Swift-Hohenberg (SH) and Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equations, 
for Reaction-Diffusion systems such as Schnakenberg and the Brusselator, 
and some Allen-Cahn type problems but on curved manifolds. 

symtut: Simple demos explaining how to deal with ** symmetries and constraints ** 
which naturally also occur in various other demos. 

modtut: Demos explaining implementations of "other right hand sides" and of 
modified discretizations, e.g., acG and schnakG for AC resp.Schnakenberg on graphs, 
and ac1Dcheb and ac1Dfou for the AC equation discretized by Chebychev nodes and 
Fourier nodes. 

misc: Various demos, mostly older, i.e., related to the original pde2path-paper 
(NMTMA 2014), but updated to the current pde2path syntax. 

ampsysdemos: Demos explaining the ampsys-module of pde2path to (numerically) derive 
(coefficients for) amplitude equations for some pattern forming systems.  

outdated: Old demos, which in newer versions became part of different tutorials and 
hence of other demo directories.
