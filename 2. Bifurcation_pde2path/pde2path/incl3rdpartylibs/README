For convenience, here we include some 3rd party libraries used in pde2path. 
These are free software (GPL2.0 or higher, or MIT), and, like all of 
pde2path, come WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. See the subdirectories for further 
licensing details, and the URLs given below. 
Some of the included libraries are strongly reduced versions of the originals, 
and in any case we refer to the respective URLs for further information and updates. 

ameshcoars: a strongly reduced version of the original library 
    available at github.com/aschmidtuulm/ameshcoars
distmesh: a verbatim copy of persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/
    In particular includes readily mexed functions (linux, mac and win), 
    of which we mainly use trisurfupd for remeshing surfaces. 
gptoolp2p: a strongly reduced version of github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox, 
    which is very comprehensive. Here we only use a small part of it, 
    in connection with geometric bifurcation problems. 
FSELIB: Subset of functions described in C.Pozrikidis 'Finite and spectral elements', 
    Taylor and Francis 2014, and there licensed under GPLv3. 
pqzschur: periodic QZ Schur decomposition by Daniel Kressner with some small mods, 
    used to compute Floquet multipliers. 
trullekrul: see github.com/KristianE86/trullekrul
