This repository is example code for 
Nonlinear Systems ME 3295-001/ME 5895-001/ECE 6095-004
at University of Connecticut, taught by Dr. Chang Liu (https://changliulab.engineering.uconn.edu/).

This provide examples to use YALMIP (https://yalmip.github.io/) for searching Lyapunov function and pde2path (https://www.staff.uni-oldenburg.de/hannes.uecker/pde2path/) to conduct bifurcation analysis.

These softwares have been already downloaded and unzipped. 

Running install.m will finish one click installation.

For YALMIP, this repository already has SeDuMi (https://sedumi.ie.lehigh.edu/?page_id=58) as semi-definite programming solver.
This solver can be changed to others such as Mosek (https://www.mosek.com/). 

The example code has comments that should be easy to understand.
